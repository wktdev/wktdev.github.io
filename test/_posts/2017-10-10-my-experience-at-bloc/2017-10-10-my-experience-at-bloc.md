#My Experience at Bloc

Previous to my experience with Bloc, I had taken a front-end development course with Code Academy that gave me a foundation of both HTML and CSS. The course was also supposed to introduce Javascript, but to me it lacked incredibly. After the course with Code Academy, I realized I wanted to learn more front-end developing languages, with an emphasis in Javascript. 

That is when I started here at Bloc.

Why I chose Bloc over other coding bootcamps?

A few reasons reasons:

	1) It's affordable

	2) It's online

	3) It's part-time 

	4) You get a mentor

All of these reasons are I think what everyone questions when they first start looking into Bootcamps. Some people who have more experience in the work force might not see money as a big enough issue as they have careers started and might have money saved, but for some like me (a kind-of recent grad) I needed something that wouldn't exactly break the bank. Bloc's price point was well within my range.

The second reason I chose Bloc is because it is online. OK OK at first I was a little nervous that it was online as I've never before taken an online course, let alone a complete 6 to 9 month program! I wasn't sure how the whole self-paced would work for me, but I don't do so bad. I can choose when and when not to do something and I know it is completely on me how far along I get in this process.

The third reason kind of also ties into affordability. Honestly I couldn't afford to leave my new job to go to another city unemployed to start a boot camp + find housing (most of these bootcamps are in big cities and bit cities mean higher rent). Right now I have a part-time job and when I'm not working at my job I work on Bloc related things. It really works well for me. It's greeeeat!

Lastly, I joined Bloc because it came with a mentor. I have always done well when I get help from someone else. And I also like learning with others, so the mentor was a big +. As I've mentioned in some of my other blog posts, I first took a course with Code Academy and they also provied a mentor, so the fact that Bloc provided that was a huuuuge bonus point. 

I think the only downside that with the whole mentorship in my opinion (though I really appreciate both the mentors I have, it is nothing against them) is that there were no female mentors for me to choose. Since I am a female sometimes I do feel way more comfortable with other girls as we share the same experiences in the workforce. But other that that little downside Bloc has been great to me so far.


As of now with Bloc I have learned what it takes to create a project from start to finish. I have also learned the complexity of Javascript and jQuery. I have to be honest though, from time to time the Javascript has gotten to me so much (I've found it extremely difficult) I've had to mentally withdraw myself from the program because I can be impatient. Nonetheless I've come back and found the will to learn about coding to be much stronger.
 

In this experience both of my mentors have been incredibly patient and attentive and have been invaluable to me.
