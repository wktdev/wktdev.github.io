title: How I Started Coding

#My journey into C0DING


Honestly, I can't remember exactly what it was that encourged me to start programming. I have taken computer science courses in both high school and college. My high school was a magnet school, and our school was geared toward engineering (and computer science), so computer science was a requirement when we were sophomores, but I can't remember what language we learned... it may have been Javascript. All I know was that my teachers name was Mr. Wood. He was awesome!

Then in college my computer science class was Intro to Python. It wasn't hard but it also wasn't easy, I did OK in the class.
All I know is that I've had exposure to programming here and there.

If I remember correctly, I believe I got into coding because I wanted to create my own website. Now I knew there was a way I could just go into a website and just add things here and there (such as **Godaddy**, **Wix**) but I wanted to create it myself, completely from scratch. That's when I started looking around for books around the library and online so I could teach myself. Then one day, I was having a conversation with my cousin who suggested Code Academy. From there I started learning the basics-- HTML and CSS. After taking some of those courses I saw an ad on their website-- becoming a freelance web developer. The ad said it would teach me about HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap and provide a mentor. After a lot of thought I decided on taking the class (Hey, it wasn't free!). The course gave me a very strong of HTML and CSS. The projects I created were fun!

The ad's description read that it would teach the basics of Javascript and Bootstrap, but I personally felt it lacked.

Most of the course we learned about HTML, CSS and how to work both of them together but Javascript and Bootstrap were crammed in the last week of the course. I was disappointed but despite that last week, I knew that throughout the entire course I had actually learned a lot. The amount I had learned encouraged me to want to learn more. From there, with the encouragement and conversation from a Code Academy mentor, I decided I  would do look into bootcamps. 

I knew it would have to be remote as I couldn't afford to go somewhere for a couple of months without a job. After a lot of research I felt Bloc would be the best fit for me because it was remote and because it was as expensive as the others.
