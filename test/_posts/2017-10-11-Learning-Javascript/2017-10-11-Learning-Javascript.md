#Learning Javascript

Learning Javascript and it's library, jQuery, is extremely daunting. I had previously
been introduced to HTML and CSS while learning front-end development using Code Academy,
so it was completely new--I had zero experience. During module 2 with bloc, we began using Code School
to learn the beginning concepts of Javascript. Lucky enough for me, since I had previously taken a class
during college in which I learned Python, I took in *some* of Javascript's concepts with ease. So since the beginning of learning Javascript was not as difficult as I thought as it would be, I actually believed Javascript was not going to be as dfficult for me. Boy was I wrong. Javascript is HARD. It really is. 

During module two, there have been times I have thought quitting the program altogether. There have also been times where I have had to mentally check out of the program for some time because I was stuck. I was either stuck on a concept, a checkpoint, or a piece of code. It didn't matter what I was stuck on, I was overwhelmed and I just needed to check out. Now I know that Bloc tells you to work on Bloc every single day or else you'll get behind or won't keep at that routine you have, and although I do find that to be true, I also find it re energinzing to sort of checkout, even for a day, and come back a bit more refreshed once you've thought a concept or a code through a bit more. 

Going back to what I earlier wrote, there were times where I thought about quitting the program because I couldn't get past whatever I was stuck on. Despite the thought, I knew I wouldn't actually quit. I had put too much time and energy into the program. It would either take a lot for me to quit or be another. Alot. 

I write all this because while I was struggling through this I realized that I was feeling very alone with my struggles. I barely ever read anything on Slack about peole saying they were struggling, so it was rough. It wasn't until either a post on slack or one of the bloc Facebook page where someone wrote that they were confused about javascript and they were discouraged that I feel less alone and knew I could get through this. So I write this so if anyone out there is reading, they know you aren't alone. I went through the SAME boat.

So I guess all in all we just need to learn to make Javascript our friend. Because Javascript is what did this to me!!! 

Anyways right now I am still learning Javascript and jQuery and it is still daunting. It is a language I will have
to be patient with and study A LOT but I know with more practice I will get better.


All in all, I have created a *fun* table displaying my perception of each coding
languages difficulty that is listed below.


| Language:    | Difficulty 1 - 100000 |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| HTML         | 38                    |
| CSS          | 166                   |
| Javascript   | *BAH*!11!!            |
| jQuery       | **50COOCOO00**        |


For some comic relief, below is a bit that describes how I fell about Javscript
sometimes:
