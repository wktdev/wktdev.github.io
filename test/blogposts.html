                        <p> Honestly, I can't remember exactly what it was that encourged me to start programming. I have taken computer science courses in both high school and college. My high school was a magnet school, and our school was geared toward engineering (and computer science), so computer science was a requirement when we were sophomores, but I can't remember what language we learned... it may have been Javascript. All I know was that my teachers name was Mr. Wood. He was awesome... <a href="_posts/2017-10-10-my-experience-at-bloc/index.html">Read more</a></p>

                        <p> Learning Javascript and it's library, jQuery, is extremely daunting. I had previously been introduced to HTML and CSS while learning front-end development using Code Academy, so it was completely new--I had zero experience. During module 2 with bloc, we began using Code School to learn the beginning concepts of Javascript. Lucky enough for me, since I had previously taken a class during college in which I learned Python, I t.. <a href="_posts/2017-10-11-Learning-Javascript/index.html">Read more</a></p>

                    <p> Previous to my experience with Bloc, I had taken a front-end development course with Code Academy that gave me a foundation of both HTML and CSS. The course was also supposed to introduce Javascript, but to me it lacked incredibly. After the course with Code Academy, I realized I wanted to learn more front-end developing languages, with an emphasis in Javascript. <a href="_posts/2017-10-10-my-experience-at-bloc/index.html">Read more</a> </p>
